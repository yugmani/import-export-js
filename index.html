  <h1>JavaScript Modules</h1>
  <ul>
    <li>As our program grows bigger, it may contain many lines of code.</li>
    <li>
      Instead of putting everything in a single file, you can use modules to
      separate codes in separate files as per their functionality.
    </li>
    <li>This makes our code organized and easier to maintain.</li>
    <li>
      Module is a file that contains code to perform a specific task. A module
      may contain variables, functions, classes etc.
    </li>
    <li>
      You can only access exported functions, objects, etc. from the module.
    </li>
    <li>
      You need to use the export keyword for the particular function, objects,
      etc. to import them and use them in other files.
    </li>
    <li><strong>Export Multiple Objects</strong></li>
    <li>
      <h3>Renaming imports and exports:</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          If the objects (variables, functions etc.) that you want to import are
          already present in your main file, the program may not behave as you
          want.
        </li>
        <li>
          In this case, the program takes value from the main file instead of
          the imported file.
        </li>
        <li>
          To avoid naming conflicts, you can rename these functions, objects,
          etc. during the export or during the import .
        </li>
        <li>Rename in the module(export file)</li>
        <li>Rename in the import file</li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li>
      <h3>Default Export</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          You can directly use the default export without enclosing curly
          brackets {}
        </li>
        <li>You can rename the imported object directly in import file.</li>
        <li>
          A file can contain multiple exports. However, you can only have one
          default export in a file.
        </li>
      </ol>
    </li>
    <li><h3>By default, modules are in strict mode.</h3></li>
    <li>
      <h3>Benefits of Using Module</h3>
      <ol>
        <li>
          The code base is easier to maintain because different code having
          different functionalities are in different files.
        </li>
        <li>
          Makes code reusable. You can define a module and use it numerous times
          as per your needs.
        </li>
        <li>
          The use of import/export may not be supported in some browsers. To
